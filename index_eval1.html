			<h1>Website Evaluation: Jackson Library at UNCG</h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Jackson Library, on The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) campus, is a bustling hub of student, faculty, and staff activity. The space itself is well laid out, providing a wide variety of tools, services, and spaces to the campus community. The campus community, however, extends well beyond the physical boundaries of the campus, with increasingly, many students who never physically visit campus, let alone the library, over their entire career at the institution. While the main population of users are local, the staff at Jackson Library has spent many years refining their website to provide tools and services useful to the distance learning community, while retaining the level of quality for which they are locally known.</p>

			<h2>The Main Page</h2>
			<p>The main page of the website at <a href="http://library.uncg.edu/">library.uncg.edu</a> puts the most important tools front and center. Within the University mandated template, the Library header provides first and foremost a simple search box. The search box includes a variety of tools for refining a search, and a link to an Advanced Search page, allowing users to create detailed and specific searches for materials. It also provides links to a variety of library collection resources.</p>

			<h2 id=S2>Site Components</h2>
			<p>Most users to the library site are looking for collection materials, in a variety of forms, no doubt. Providing a simple, yet powerful, tool for this service, right up front, allows these users to do what they need to do quickly and efficiently. For those users who are less experienced, and perhaps unsure of what they need, the library staff provides those tools right up front as well. Just to one side of the main search tools, a list of links for live chat with a librarian, research help, and frequently asked questions are easily accessible.</p>
		
			<p>Scanning down the front page, a user is just a click away from a wide selection of information and services. Just below the search box and menus, the library staff have provided an up to date list of available spaces and technology equipment for the use of local students, faculty, or staff. A nice feature in this list is the link providing the number of desktop workstations available for use. This links to a map of library spaces where desktop workstations are located, regularly updating which machines are in use or available and where they are in the library. For those users on campus, this tool neatly informs a decision about whether to go to the library to use a computer or not. This is especially useful at high volume times of the semester.</p>

It's a neat feature and I haven't noticed it before-->
			</a>
			
			<p>Other components of the website include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Menus</strong> linking users to the Libraryâ€™s vast collection of resources and services available both on and off campus</li>
					<li><strong>News</strong> items highlighting useful resources, informative blogs, and upcoming events</li>
					<li><strong>Links</strong> for accessing databases and journals to facilitate research projects</li>
					<li><strong>Secondary links</strong> to frequently requested information regarding policies and the library itself</li>
					<li><strong>University website header and footer</strong> providing tools, utilities, and information to provide links back to the UNCG main website</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
			<p>The Jackson Library website first and foremost provides efficient access to the library collections and support of academic and research activities for users both on and off-campus. The library staff have developed many services that can be offered online as well as in person, greatly expanding the ability of off-campus students to make use of the library. The site is cleanly organized, and simply and logically laid out. The developers have done a great job in keeping the layout simple and clean, but also providing clear pathways for accessing their abundant resources.</p>
